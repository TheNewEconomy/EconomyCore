The New Economy, TNE, is the ultimate economy plugin for your Minecraft server, no matter what platform you're on. While
TNE is pushed as being "feature-packed," but it's not feature-packed in the normal sense of jamming a bunch of useless features
into the core plugin, but rather using modules.

# About TNE
TNE was originally created for hey0's hMod long before Bukkit/Spigot/Paper was a thing. Since then, it has taken on many
forms and this is the future form of the plugin. This core is designed to be robust and carry TNE into the future with or
without Minecraft by not being platform-dependent.

# Requirements
TNE has some minimum requirements that should be followed.

# 0.1.3.1

## Supporting TNE
I have decided to launch a GitHub Sponsors page for those who are able to provide support for TNE development! You may find it here: https://github.com/sponsors/creatorfromhell

This GitHub Sponsors page will be used to help fund development and maintenance costs. As I start to create modules for TNE, I'll add access to them for Sponsors!

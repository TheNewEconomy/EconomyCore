## Major Changes

## Minor Changes
- Added currency commands.
  - These are commands that utilize the currency identifiers to provide an easier way to interact with the currency.
  - These commands are an alternative to the /money commandset and allow players to use the commands without needing to specify the currency
  - Example: /gold pay notch 10 - will pay notch 10 of currency "gold."

## Fixes
- Fixes issue with enderchest balances when using shulker boxes and /t deposit all
- Fixes incompatibility with MoDispenserMechanics since for some reason they utilize a fake player.

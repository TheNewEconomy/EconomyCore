## Major Changes

## Minor Changes
- Added currency commands.
  - These are commands that use the currency identifiers to provide an easier way to interact with the currency.
  - These commands are an alternative to the /money commandset and allow players to use the commands without needing to specify the currency
  - Example: /gold pay notch 10 - will pay notch 10 of currency "gold."
  - This is able to be enabled/disabled in the currency config file.
- Added ability to configure max balance limits for each currency based off permission nodes.
  - If the account is not a player account, or the player has no nodes matching limits, the currency max balance is used.

Config example:
```
  #Ability to limit balances based on a player's permission
  Limit:

  Enabled: false

  #The permission nodes for each balance limit.
  #The key is the balance limit, the value is the permission node.
  Permissions:

      1000000: "tne.currency.usd.limit.1000000"
```

- Added loads of additional configurations for redis.
